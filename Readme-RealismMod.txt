-----------------------------------------------------

Description:
 - AgentGOD's attempt to get Call of Duty as realistic as possible
 - Highly anticipated Modern Warfare 2 PC Mod
 - Fixes major game exploits

What is modded:
 - No crosshairs
 - No hit-marks (i.e. no more random wall sprays)
 - No jumping (no more bunny hoppers jumping while being shot)
 - Limited grenade launchers (no more noob-tube spaming)
 - Allies (Americans, SEALS, TF141) spawn with M16A4, M4A1, M240, or M82A1 Barrett
 - Axis (Opfor, Thugs, Russians) spawn with AK-47, TAR-21, RPD, or Intervention (wish this game had the SVD)
 - More realistic damages: rebalanced for new gameplay style
 - Higher ROF for the M16A4 to better match the AK-47 (balance)
 - Greeting message introducing users to the mod at spawn (one time)
 - Instruction for which button to press to choose weapon
 - Fixes a classic infamous game exploit
 - Level playing field: no more akimbo 1887s, akimbo G18s, etc
 - Skips original CoD class-selection menu
 - Fixes weapon-change-on-spawn exploit
 - Enforces 80-degree FOV throughout the game for a more realistic feel
[(below changes added in v2.00)]
 - Opfor side now has suicide bombing ability (limited to 2 player max by default)
 - Suicide bombers can be defeated without being blown up by a headshot or knife kill
 - 3 kinds of incapacitation: disables ADS when shot on arms, forces prone/crouch when shot on legs,
   and forces weapon drop when shot in the hands
 - Better, easier to read introduction text, and now displays twice (first two consecutive spawns)
 - More straight-forward class selection than before
 - Now includes spawn protection (lasts for 15 seconds)
 - Removed annoying game spawn objective message
 - Limited enemy red label appearance
 - Gun hipfire accuracy greatly reduced *may require fast_restart
 - Knife now kills in one attempt (bug fix)
 - Class selection instruction will now stop printing upon selecting a class
 - Ammo is precious, learn to conserve. Now you are only given 3 magazines for AR's,
   and one M203/GP-25 round (need to load before using).
 - Removed 'Tactical Nuke' killstreak (for games that have Killstreaks enabled)
 - Player controls are frozen on spawn and unfrozen when class is chosen
 - Fixes the infamous team-kill (for positive points) game exploit completely
    (Had to do this as Infinity Ward had neglected to do it for months)
 - Reloading weapons will now have a longer time penalty *may require fast_restart
 - Victims of suicide bombers are warned about how to disable his bomb
 - Enforces tactical realism by encouraging crouch/prone when moving on the battlefield
 - Fixed a bug that prevented ladder climbing after being incapacitated
 - Jumping is now allowed, but with 2 jump limit + cooldown
